# Color-Game

Color Game is a simple project built as a part of the coursework of the course title "Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy. The game randomly picks up a bunch of colors and provides the RGB value of one of these colors. The user has to determine the correct color given for a particular set of RGB values.
